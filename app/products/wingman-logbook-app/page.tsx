/**
 * WingmanLogbookApp Page
 * 
 * This page includes scroll-triggered background color changes for different sections.
 * 
 * HOW THE BACKGROUND COLOR CHANGES WORK:
 * 
 * 1. We use the useScrollBackground hook to set up which sections should 
 *    change the background color when they're visible.
 * 
 * 2. For each section:
 *    - targetId:  The HTML ID of the section (must match the ID in the HTML below)
 *    - color:     The Tailwind CSS class to apply for the background (and text if needed)
 *    - priority:  Which section "wins" when multiple are visible (higher number wins)
 *    - threshold: How much of the section must be visible to trigger (0.4 = 40%)
 * 
 * 3. The background changes happen automatically as you scroll through the page.
 *    - When a section is 40% visible, its background color activates
 *    - When multiple sections are visible, the one with higher priority wins
 *    - When no sections are visible, the background returns to default
 * 
 * 4. All transitions between colors are smooth thanks to CSS transitions
 *    defined in the globals.css file.
