# New DGCA FDTL Revisions: 6 Key things that you should know

*Writer: Wingman Log | January 8, 2024 | 3 min read*

## Introduction

Ah, the aviation world, where schedules are as tight as a well-tailored pilot's uniform. But hold on to your seat belts, folks! The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has just dropped a regulatory bombshell, and we're here to decode the high-flying drama.

##   

## Decoding the new revision

The DGCA press release, akin to decoding a cryptic pilot message, unfolds six pivotal changes. From extended weekly rest periods to redefined night duties, it's a symphony of reform notes. We're not just talking about tweaking flight schedules; we're talking about redefining the aviation rhythm. So, buckle up for the breakdown!

But wait, the aviation Twitterverse has its dissenting notes as always. \[@BanditOnYour6 says\]([https://twitter.com/BanditOnYour6/status/1744306159446638699](https://twitter.com/BanditOnYour6/status/1744306159446638699)) FRMS has been around since our flip phones.

### Understanding the "why"

While specific data on accidents and incidents due to crew fatigue in India is not readily available, fatigue remains a significant issue in aviation, both globally and in India. According to a study by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), fatigue was reported as a causative factor in 12% of the US Navy's Class A accidents in 1997\[1\]. Fatigue contributes to nearly 15 to 20% of accidents in commercial aviation\[2\]. A study analyzing 30 accidents in which pilot fatigue was a factor, 35 incidents in which pilot fatigue was a factor, and 28 accidents in which pilot fatigue was not a factor\[5\].

While true, it's like saying, "Oh, airplanes? They've been around since the Wright brothers." True, but it's the tech upgrade that counts. DGCA's late entry into the FRMS club? Better late than never, I say.

### Challenges for Operators:

Now, the million-dollar question – Operators, get ready for some turbulence. Implementing these reforms won't be a smooth takeoff. Scheduling headaches, training turbulence, and a bit of financial fog – it's like navigating through an industry storm. But hey, if we were able to figure out how to operate multi million dollar airplanes through thick fog, I'm sure they will figure out a way through this as well, just hoping that it's not one step forward and two steps back.

### June 01, 2024, and the Hiring Conundrum

Fast forward to June 01, 2024. A date that's got the aviation community buzzing like a runway full of busy bees. But here's the unsolved mystery: Will airlines hire more crew to cope with the changes? It's an open-ended question, like an inflight Wi-Fi signal. Will we get answers before reaching cruising altitude?

### One Small Step for DGCA, One Giant Leap for Pilots

In the grand scheme of aviation, DGCA's flight duty reforms are more than just regulatory tweaks. They're a step toward safer skies, a nod to the well-being of our flight crews. It's DGCA saying, "Here's to well-rested pilots, clearer skies, and a future where flying is not just a journey but an experience." One small step for DGCA, one giant leap for pilots.
