### Step 7: Visit the Examiner

It's time for your actual medical examination! Visit the DGCA empaneled Class 1 Examiner, validate the form in front of the examiners, and carry a hard copy of the ID proof you uploaded during registration.

### Step 8: Getting the CA 35

After the examination, the examiner will conduct a checkup and issue a CA-35 medical certificate if you're deemed fit. This certificate can be downloaded from the eGCA portal for your records. ***Services -> Medical Services -> Download Certificate/Assessment -> View CA 35***

Your medical application will be received by the DMS(CA) at the Medical Directorate, who will mark you as fit, temporarily unfit, or permanently unfit based on the assessment.

### Step 9: Results of Your Assessment

If you're deemed fit, your medical assessment will be sent through the eGCA portal and via email. In case of temporary unfitness, recommendations will be communicated to you via email. If you're permanently unfit, your application goes to DGMS (air) for approval.

### Step 10: Access Your Medical Assessment

Finally, a medical assessment will be generated, and a PDF will be available for download at the eGCA portal, accessible through your applicant login. ***Services -> Medical Services -> Download Certificate/Assessment -> View Medical Assessment***

That's it! You've successfully renewed your Class 1 Medical on eGCA, ensuring that you're physically fit to take to the skies. Renewing your medical certificate is vital for pilots, so follow these steps, maintain good health, and keep the spirit of aviation alive!
