*Writer: Wingman Log | May 17, 2024 | 5 min read*

Are you a pilot or aspiring to become one, seeking clarity on the process of renewing, issuing, or converting Radio Telephony (RTR) licenses?

Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down the detailed steps and required documents for each procedure, ensuring you navigate the process smoothly.

RTR licenses are essential for pilots and aviation professionals, allowing them to operate communication equipment within aeronautical services. Whether you're applying for a new license, renewing an existing one, or converting a foreign license, the process involves specific steps and documentation.

## Eligibility Criteria

Before applying for the RTR license, ensure you meet the following eligibility criteria:

1.  Age: You must be at least 18 years old.
    
2.  Education: A minimum educational qualification of 10+2 with Physics and Mathematics is required.
    
3.  Language Proficiency: Proficiency in English, as the exam and aviation communication are conducted in English.

## Steps to Obtain an RTR License

#### 1\. Application Submission

Start by submitting your application to the Wireless Planning and Coordination (WPC) Wing. The application form is available on the WPC website or can be obtained from their office. Fill out the form carefully, ensuring all details are accurate.

#### 2\. Examination Fee

Pay the examination fee as specified by the WPC. The fee can be paid online or through a demand draft, as per the instructions provided on the WPC website.

#### 3\. Exam Preparation

The RTR examination consists of two parts:

*   *Part 1: Written Examination*  
    
*   Syllabus: Covers topics like aviation meteorology, navigation, principles of radio communication, and regulations.
    
*   Preparation: Study the syllabus thoroughly. Recommended books include "Aviation Regulations" by RK BALI and "Radio Telephony Handbook" by FAA.
    
*   *Part 2: Practical Examination*
    
*   Content: Tests your ability to handle real-time communication scenarios, including distress and emergency procedures.
    
*   Preparation: Practice simulated communication exercises and familiarize yourself with standard phraseology.

### Which RTR license should I apply for if I have done CPL outside India?

If you have completed your Commercial Pilot License (CPL) outside of India, you would typically apply for an Indian RTR(A) license. This license is specifically designed for individuals holding CPL qualifications and is necessary for operating radio transmitting equipment onboard aircraft within Indian airspace.

### How many exams are to be given for a Full Indian RTR(A) license?

To obtain a Full Indian RTR(A) license, you will need to pass exams: the Radio Telephony Restricted (Aeronautical) exam Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is more of a practical assessment where you are expected to converse with standard radio phraseology and Part 2 is an Oral exam testing you on the RT regulations and instruments.

### How to prepare for Indian RTR exams - study materials?

Preparing for Indian RTR exams requires diligent study and understanding of aeronautical communication procedures. It's essential to utilize comprehensive study materials that cover topics such as radio phraseology, aviation regulations, and operational procedures. Online resources, textbooks, and practice exams can be valuable tools in your preparation.

### What is the process to convert a UK RTR or RT license from any Commonwealth country to an Indian RTR?

To convert a UK RTR or RT license from any Commonwealth country to an Indian RTR, you will need to undergo a process of validation.

2\. Required Documents: Attested copies of foreign FRTOL, valid Flight Crew Licenses, Experience Certificate, Passport, and two passport-size photographs.
