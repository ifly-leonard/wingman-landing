# How to apply for DGCA computer number?

*Writer: Wingman Log | June 17, 2023 | 4 min read*

Before taking the DGCA exams, candidates need to apply for a special number called a "Computer Number." To apply, they must have a valid diploma marksheet or a marksheet from class 12 that includes physics and mathematics.

**The application process can be done on the website** [**pariksha.dgca.gov.in**](https://pariksha.dgca.gov.in/)**.**

Once you receive your computer number, you can apply for the exams on the same website when the test portal is open. Usually, the portal is open for about a week to ten days. Getting a computer number involves following several procedures, submitting various documents, and providing specific information. Although it may seem complicated, we have simplified the process to increase your chances of getting your computer number application approved on the first try.

Here are the steps to apply for a computer number:

**Step 1:**

*   Register on the [DGCA Pariksha](https://pariksha.dgca.gov.in/) website.
    
*   Choose "*NEW CANDIDATE REGISTRATION*" in the FLIGHT CREW section.
    
*   Read the instructions on the screen carefully.
    
*   Accept the guidelines and enter your personal information.
    
*   Verify your email and phone number using an OTP.
    
*   Create a password.
    
*   Your Login ID and Password will be created, which you can use to apply for a computer number.

**Step 2:**

*   Begin your *Computer Number Application*.
    
*   To apply for a commercial pilot license, you will need marksheets and passing certificates from both Class 10 and Class 12.
    
*   These marksheets need to be verified by the respective educational board such as CBSE, ICSE, or the specified state board.
    
*   Board verification ensures the authenticity of your marksheets and confirms that you have passed Grade 10 and Grade 12 Exams with Physics, Math, and English in Grade 12.
    
*   An attested Board Verification certificate from your educational board verifies the validity of your marksheets.
    
*   Each educational board has its own process for board verification. CBSE and ICSE offer online verification, while regional state boards have their own methods.

Be careful when entering all the information, as spelling mistakes are a common reason for application rejection. Upload digital or scanned copies of the required documents on the designated Upload page. Make sure the documents fit within the specified size limit and are clear without any blurring or pixelation.

**Step 3:**

*   Once you have provided all the required information and uploaded the documents correctly, a *REVIEW* page will appear.
    
*   Double-check the entire form and ensure the spelling is accurate.
    
*   Make sure the information matches the supporting documents.
    
*   After thoroughly reviewing all the data, submit the form.

**Step 4:**

*   Print the completed form and all the uploaded supporting documents that have been self-attested (such as Aadhar Card, Marksheet, Passport, etc.).
    
*   The process of attesting the Board Verification Certificate is different.
    
*   If the certificate is issued in the DGCA's name, it must be provided in a sealed form (request a photocopy or scan from the Board Office before sealing the envelope to keep a digital copy).
    
*   If the certificate is issued in your name, it must be confirmed by a [*CLASS 1 GAZETTED OFFICER.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetted_Officer_(India)#Group_A_(Gazetted),_formerly_called_Class_I)
    
*   If the certificate is issued in your flying school's name, your CFI must certify it.

Review the document size for each document to submit the application.

Within 10 days of submitting your online application, send the printed form and any necessary supporting documents to the DGCA through speed post only.

After the DGCA reviews your application, you will receive your computer number within six to eight weeks.
