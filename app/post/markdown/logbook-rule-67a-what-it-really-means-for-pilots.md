# Logbook Rule 67A: What It Really Means for Pilots

*Writer: Wingman Log | October 25, 2024 | 4 min read*

As a pilot, your logbook is your aviation diary, a record of every flight hour that builds your professional journey. Rule 67A, from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), provides strict guidance on how to maintain this logbook accurately. While the official rule is clear and concise, it can feel a bit overwhelming. Let's break it down, quote the exact words from the rulebook, and interpret it in a way that's easy to follow. Here’s what every pilot needs to know.

## What Rule 67A Says: The Exact Language

> "*Every pilot shall maintain a personal flying logbook in the prescribed form issued by the Directorate, which must be filled up and signed after each flight or series of flights. "The logbook shall contain a true and accurate record of the total number of hours flown, nature of flight, type of aircraft, and any other relevant particulars as may be required."*

###   

## Interpreting Rule 67A: What Does This Mean?

#### 1\. You Are Responsible for Your Logbook

The responsibility to maintain a personal logbook rests solely on you as a pilot. This means no one else can do it for you—not your airline, not your flight school, and not an admin. It's **your record** of your flying hours, and DGCA expects you to fill in every detail.

#### Why it matters: 

Your flying logbook is proof of your experience and essential for career advancements, endorsements, and certifications. Falsifying or neglecting it could harm your credibility and even result in penalties.

#### 2\. Keep It Updated After Each Flight

After every flight or series of flights, you’re required to immediately update your logbook. DGCA makes this very clear—there’s no room for backdating or waiting till the end of the week to enter your hours.

#### Why it matters:

 Keeping your logbook up-to-date not only helps you avoid confusion later, but it also ensures that you are ready for any spot checks from DGCA or your employer. Staying prompt means staying compliant.

#### 3\. Complete and True Record

Your logbook must include specific details: the total number of hours flown, the type of flight (such as solo, dual, or cross-country), the aircraft type, and any other details that the DGCA might require.

#### Why it matters: 

#### This isn’t just a formality. Incomplete or inaccurate logbooks could lead to misunderstandings during audits, missing endorsements, or even the invalidation of your logged hours. It’s essential to provide **complete transparency** in your flight details to avoid complications in licensing or upgrades.

#### 4\. More Than Just Hours

#### In addition to flying hours, your logbook must include details like **the type of flight** (was it solo, training, or an IFR flight?), the type of aircraft (single-engine, multi-engine, jet, etc.), and any other important information, like whether you acted as Pilot-in-Command (PIC) or Second-in-Command (SIC).

#### Why it matters:

 Specifics like these will be crucial when you apply for advanced licenses or job opportunities. They provide a clear picture of your skill set and flying proficiency. So, don’t skimp on these details.

## The Takeaway: Rule 67A Simplified

At its core, Rule 67A is about ensuring accountability, accuracy, and transparency. It’s not just about logging hours; it’s about building a reliable record of your professional flying experience. Following this rule ensures that your career path stays on track, with no regulatory hiccups along the way.

In a nutshell:

*   **You** are responsible for maintaining your logbook.
    
*   Update it **after each flight** without delay.
    
*   Record every detail accurately—**hours, flight type, aircraft type**, and more.

By staying compliant with Rule 67A, you're not only meeting DGCA’s standards but also safeguarding your own professional journey.
