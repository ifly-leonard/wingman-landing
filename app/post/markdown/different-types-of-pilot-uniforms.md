IndiGo, known for its punctuality, seamless service, and affordability, is introducing a retro-style pilot uniform designed by renowned fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh. This classic attire includes a navy blue bomber jacket, a white shirt, and comfortable trousers, inspired by World War II bomber jackets. It's made from wool-rich hopsack weave, with both summer and winter trouser options. The shirt offers breathability and low maintenance in long and short sleeves. The design combines functionality with timeless retro appeal, aligning with IndiGo's no-nonsense spirit. The bomber jacket's debut in India adds subtle style and comfort, considering in-flight requirements. Rajesh Pratap Singh praised IndiGo's high standards and on-time commitment. This classy yet cool uniform mirrors IndiGo's chic image, enhancing the overall customer experience.
