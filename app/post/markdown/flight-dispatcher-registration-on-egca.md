# Flight Dispatcher Registration on eGCA

*Writer: Wingman Log | August 11, 2023 | 4 min read*

In the world of aviation, safety, precision, and coordination are paramount. Behind every successful flight, there's a team of experts working diligently to ensure a smooth journey. Among these professionals is the Flight Dispatcher, a key player responsible for planning routes, monitoring weather conditions, and collaborating with pilots to guarantee safe flights. The process of becoming a certified Flight Dispatcher involves a meticulous registration procedure, and in this blog, we'll dive into the intricacies of the Flight Dispatcher registration process.

## Understanding Flight Dispatcher Registration

Flight Dispatcher registration is a crucial step for individuals aiming to become certified Flight Dispatcher Users. This process entails the formal registration of personal details through the e-Governance of Civil Aviation (eGCA) platform. This digital interface facilitates efficient communication between aviation stakeholders and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), streamlining the process of becoming a certified Flight Dispatcher.

## Why Flight Dispatcher Registration Matters

Much like a pilot's license, a Flight Dispatcher's registration is more than just a formality. Upon successful registration, Flight Dispatchers receive a unique identification number or ID. This ID is a gateway to a plethora of services offered by the DGCA. From accessing regulatory information to obtaining essential resources, the Flight Dispatcher ID is an essential tool for ensuring the aviation ecosystem operates smoothly.

## Aspirant Flight Dispatcher Registration Pre-requisites

For those aspiring to become Flight Dispatchers, certain prerequisites must be met before embarking on the registration journey:

*   *Age Requirement*: Candidates must be at least 21 years old, reflecting the maturity and responsibility necessary for this critical role.
    
*   *Valid Email ID and Mobile Number*: A functional and unique email address and mobile number, not previously registered on the eGCA platform, are essential for seamless communication.
    
*   *Identity Proof*: Candidates should possess at least one valid identity proof from the list of acceptable documents, such as a driving license, passport, Aadhar card, or others.
    
*   *Educational Documents*: A copy of the 10th and 12th-grade mark sheets is required, demonstrating educational qualifications.
    
*   *Educational Qualification*: Aspirants must have successfully passed the 10+2 standard examination with Mathematics and Physics as subjects, ensuring a strong foundation for flight operations.
    
*   *Scanned Photo and Signature*: High-quality scanned copies of a passport-sized photograph and signature are needed for verification purposes.

## Existing Flight Dispatcher Registration Pre-requisites

For existing Flight Dispatchers looking to renew their registration, the following prerequisites apply:

*   Valid FD Number: Possession of a valid Flight Dispatcher Number is essential for renewal.
    
*   Valid Email ID and Mobile Number: Similar to aspirant registration, a functional email address and mobile number are necessary for communication.
    
*   Identity Proof: One valid identity proof from the provided list should be submitted for verification.
