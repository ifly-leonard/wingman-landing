# Instructions for Medical Services in eGCA

*Writer: Wingman Log | August 16, 2023 | 4 min read*

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on navigating Medical Services within the eGCA platform. This manual has been meticulously curated to address common queries and ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience for all applicants seeking medical services through eGCA. It is of paramount importance to carefully review these instructions before initiating your application process. Additionally, kindly revisit this guide each time you embark on any service application, as updates are consistently incorporated for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

Medical Services Offered

For the convenience of pilots and Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs), eGCA provides a range of medical services. The primary services include:  

1.  **Issuance of Class 1 Medical Certificate**
    
2.  **Issuance of Class 2 Medical Certificate**
    
3.  **Issuance of Class 3 Medical Certificate**

## Essential Pre-application Steps

Prior to initiating any medical service application, adhere to the following guidelines:  

1.  **User Manual Reference**: Delve into the user manuals accessible on the eGCA website, located in the "User Manual" section under the Left Panel. These manuals provide comprehensive insights into the processes and prerequisites for each service. Make sure you understand the procedure before proceeding with your application.
    
2.  **Pending Data Validation/Updation**: If you have a data validation or updation request pending approval with DGCA through the 'Medical Records Update' node, refrain from applying for any new service until the previous request is processed.
    
3.  **Profile Verification**: Regularly verify your details under "VIEW PROFILE" -> "BASIC DETAILS" to ensure accurate personal information.
    
4.  **Medical Details Update**: Accurate medical information is crucial. Verify your details under "VIEW PROFILE" -> "MEDICAL DETAILS." Update your eGCA profile with the latest medical information before proceeding with any service application.
    
5.  **Discrepancy Resolution**: If any discrepancies or changes arise in your details, raise a support cell request. Provide evidence to substantiate the required amendments.

## Offline Issuance of Medical Assessment

In cases where your Medical Assessment is issued offline, follow these steps:  

1.  **Check with Examiner**: Verify with your examiner whether your CA 35 (Medical Assessment) is generated offline or online via eGCA. If offline, both your CA 35 and DGCA-approved Medical Assessment will be offline.
    
2.  **Pending Online Application**: If your online medical application remains unprocessed due to offline issuance, it will be listed under 'Track Status' with a 'Pending' status. To avoid automatic cancellation after 60 days, cancel the application through your examiner.
    
3.  **Application Post Medical Assessment**: After DGCA receives your Medical Assessment, apply for services on eGCA after following step 4 (as mentioned below).
    
4.  **Medical Records Update**: Utilize the 'Medical Records Update' node to submit your medical details to DGCA for approval if there are any discrepancies or missing information in your eGCA profile. This applies especially if you were issued a medical assessment offline before applying for any service on eGCA.

## Auto-Cancellation of Medical Applications

Automatic cancellation of medical applications occurs under specific circumstances:  

1.  **Issuance of Medical Examination**: If an application for medical examination is either pending verification by the examiner or pending CA 35 generation after submission, it will be auto-cancelled after 60 days from eApplicationID generation.
    
2.  **Renewal of Medical Examination**: For renewal applications, if the application is pending verification by the examiner or CA 35 generation after submission, it will be auto-cancelled 60 days after eApplicationID generation or upon reaching the validity date (whichever is earlier).
    
3.  **NOC Application Approved**: If a NOC (No Objection Certificate) application is approved by DGCA and the corresponding medical application is submitted, it will be cancelled when the date of the selected exam in the NOC application has passed.

## Fees Logic for Issuance/Renewal After Cancellation

In the event of application cancellation, the following fees logic applies:  

*   If an applicant's medical application (issuance or renewal) is cancelled by the applicant, examiner, the system, or the TCS team, no new fees need to be paid for a resubmitted application within the next 60 days from the eApplicationID generation of the previous application (that was cancelled). For refunds, liaise with Bharat Kosh.
    
*   Note that this fees logic is specifically tailored for Issuance or Renewal of Medical Examination and not for 'Request for Medical NOC'. If your NOC application is cancelled, contact Bharat Kosh for refund-related inquiries.

By following these meticulous instructions, you can confidently navigate the eGCA platform for Medical Services, ensuring streamlined application submission and prompt processing. Remember to consult this manual for updated guidance whenever you engage with the eGCA services. Your cooperation guarantees a seamless experience and contributes to the efficiency of the medical service process.
