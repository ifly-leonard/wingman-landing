## What do you understand by the words Pilot Fatigue?

Fatigue in aviation refers to decreased mental or physical performance due to:
- Lack of sleep
- Long hours without rest
- Overnight shifts disrupting natural sleep cycles

ICAO mandates states to establish:
- **Flight Time**
- **Flight Duty Period**
- **Duty Period**
- **Rest Period Limitations**

If an FRMS (Fatigue Risk Management System) is authorized, the state must regulate it.

## What is FDTL?

FDTL (Flight Duty Time Limitations) are DGCA regulations that ensure pilots get adequate rest to prevent fatigue-related safety issues.


- **Duty:** Any assignment that could lead to fatigue – flying, admin, training, standby, etc.
- **Duty Period:** Time from start to end of duty.
- **Flight Duty Period (FDP):** Time from reporting for duty to engine shutdown of the last flight.
- **Flight Time (FT):** Time from first movement to complete stop ("block-to-block").
- **Acclimatized:** Crew are considered acclimatized to a time zone for 48 hours. After that, calculations adjust to local time zones.

## What is WOCL (Window of Circadian Low)?

The period from **0200h to 0600h** in the crew member’s _acclimatized time zone_ where human performance is lowest (alertness, temp, focus).

---

## What is the Aim of the FDTL?

To restrict:
- Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly flight hours
- Flight duty based on night/WOCL period
- Total duty time based on number of landings

See quick reference for two-crew and augmented operations:
