# Registration of New FTO on eGCA

*Writer: Wingman Log | August 9, 2023 | 4 min read*

Steering through the clouds and soaring to new heights, aviation has always been a dream for many. The process of becoming a pilot involves rigorous training, and behind the scenes, Flying Training Organizations (FTOs) play a crucial role in shaping future aviators. To ensure a streamlined and regulated approach, aspiring FTOs need to undergo a meticulous registration process. In this blog, we will delve into the intricacies of the process for new FTO registration, shedding light on its significance and steps.

## Understanding Flying Training Organisation Registration

Flying Training Organisation registration is a fundamental step for individuals or entities aspiring to establish themselves as recognized flight training providers. This process enables aspirant applicants to formally register their details with the e-Governance of Civil Aviation (eGCA), a digital platform that facilitates efficient interactions between aviation stakeholders and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

## Why Registration Matters

The process of FTO registration is not merely bureaucratic; it serves as the cornerstone for establishing a legitimate flight training entity. Upon successful registration, applicants receive a unique identification number or ID. This ID is more than just a combination of characters; it opens the door to a plethora of opportunities and services offered by the DGCA. From obtaining licenses to accessing essential aviation resources, this ID is a key that unlocks the world of aviation.

## Pre-requisites for Flying Training Organisation Registration

Before embarking on the journey of FTO registration, there are certain prerequisites that must be met:

1.  *Valid Email ID and Mobile Number*: A functional email address and mobile number, which have not been previously registered with the eGCA, are mandatory for seamless communication during the registration process.
    
2.  *Proposed FTO Name*: Just as a flight takes off with its call sign, an FTO needs an official name. Applicants must propose a suitable name that reflects their organization's vision and mission.
    
3.  *Date of Incorporation*: The official date of incorporation of the FTO is a vital piece of information, demonstrating the establishment's legal existence.
    
4.  *Basic Details of Authorized Person*: The driving force behind the FTO should be represented by an authorized individual. Basic details such as their name, gender, and nationality are required during the registration process.
