The aviation industry is a realm of precision and expertise, where the roles of Chief Flight Instructors (CFIs) hold paramount importance. Ensuring that these instructors meet the necessary qualifications and requirements is an essential step in maintaining aviation standards. This blog delves into the streamlined process of approving Chief Flight Instructors through the eGovernance of Civil Aviation (eGCA) platform, highlighting the steps from application submission to final approval.

## FTO and Dy.CFI Pre-requisites

2.  **FTO and Dy. CFI Registration**: Both the FTO and Dy.CFI must already be registered on the eGCA external portal with valid eGCA IDs.
    
3.  **Valid Contact Information**: Valid email IDs and mobile numbers for both the FTO and Dy.CFI are crucial.
    
4.  **Access to DGCA Website**: Access to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) website is essential for submitting and processing applications.

### Step 8: Dy. CFI Review and Approval

By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this blog, FTOs, Dy. CFIs, and aspiring CFIs can navigate the approval process seamlessly.
