# Tips & Tricks to Save Cost While Doing Your Flight Training

*Writer: Wingman Log | April 2, 2024 | 2 min read*

## Opt for Cessna 152 Instead of C172/Diamond Aircraft

   ***Savings***: Significant cost reduction due to cheaper dry operating costs.

   ***Impact/Risks***: Miss out on hands-on experience with Garmin avionics, which may be a valuable skill in future aviation endeavors.

## Self-Study for DGCA Exams

   ***Savings***: Avoid expenses associated with ground classes provided by flying schools or private institutions.

   ***Impact/Risks***: Risk of inadequate preparation leading to exam failure. However, successful self-study can result in substantial savings.

## Direct Negotiation with Flying Schools

   ***Savings***: Bypass agent fees by negotiating directly with flying schools for reduced training costs.

   ***Impact/Risks***: Possibility of less favorable terms or misunderstanding in negotiations. However, direct communication can lead to more transparent agreements.

## Consider Training in Economical Countries

   ***Savings***: Take advantage of lower training costs in countries with cheaper aviation training facilities.
