# How to Track ATPL Requirements with the Wingman App

*Writer: Wingman Log | November 25, 2024 | 3 min read*

For every pilot striving to meet DGCA’s stringent requirements for an ATPL (Airline Transport Pilot License), keeping track of flying hours is a challenge.

With various categories of hours—cross-country, night flying, PIC (Pilot-in-Command)—it’s easy to get overwhelmed. This task becomes even trickier with scattered flight records, incomplete data, or manual calculations.  

But here’s the good news: Whether your flight data is stored in eGCA or you use the Wingman app, [**Wingman’s**](https://onelink.to.wingman) **ATPL hour tracker** has you covered.
