# ELP Endorsement for ATC (Air Traffic Controllers)

*Writer: Wingman Log | August 18, 2023 | 3 min read*

The world of aviation relies heavily on the expertise of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) who ensure the safe and efficient movement of aircraft in the sky. The responsibilities of an ATC are vast, encompassing everything from providing pilots with clear instructions to coordinating take-offs, landings, and managing airspace. To perform these crucial roles, ATCs must possess the requisite skills and knowledge and a valid license. In this blog, we'll delve into the process of obtaining an Endorsement of English Language Proficiency (ELP) on an ATC license.

## Applicant Pre-requisites

Before embarking on the journey to secure an Endorsement of ELP on their ATC license, applicants need to fulfill a few pre-requisites:

1.  **eGCA Registration**: Prospective applicants must be registered on the eGCA (e-Governance Civil Aviation) external portal, which serves as a centralized platform for various aviation-related services.
    
2.  **Valid eGCA ID**: Having a valid eGCA ID is essential for accessing and utilizing the services provided on the portal.
    
3.  **DGCA Website Access**: Applicants must also have access to the official website of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the regulatory body overseeing civil aviation activities in the respective jurisdiction.

## Step-by-Step Process

Let's walk through the step-by-step process that an applicant needs to follow to obtain an Endorsement of ELP on their ATC license:

**Step 1: eGCA Portal Login**

The first step involves visiting the eGCA portal and clicking on the "eGCA Login" option. This action takes the applicant to the login page where they need to provide their eGCA ID, password, and complete a captcha verification.

**Step 2: Applicant Login**

Upon successful login, the applicant gains access to their eGCA dashboard. This is the hub where they can manage various aviation-related services and applications.

In the eGCA dashboard, the applicant selects the "Services" tab, which opens a dropdown menu of available services. Among these options, they need to click on "Application for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) License and Rating."

**Step 5: Completing the Application Form**

After selecting the "Endorsement of ELP" option, the applicant can proceed to fill out the required application form. This form typically requests personal information, previous license details, and any other relevant data needed for processing the endorsement.

**Step 6: Submission and Request ID Generation** Once the application form is completed, the applicant can review the information for accuracy and completeness. After ensuring that all details are accurate, they can submit the form. Upon submission, the eGCA system generates a unique request ID for the endorsement application.
