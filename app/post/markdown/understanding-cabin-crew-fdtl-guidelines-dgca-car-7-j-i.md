# Understanding Cabin Crew FDTL Guidelines (DGCA-CAR-7-J-I)

*Writer: Wingman Log | October 23, 2024 | 5 min read*

The **Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)** in India enforces safety regulations across aviation operations. One such important regulation for cabin crew is **DGCA-CAR-7-J-I-FDTL (Cabin Crew) 2018**, which provides guidelines for **Flight and Duty Time Limitations (FDTL)**. Understanding these regulations ensures that cabin crew work within safe limits, protecting both their well-being and passengers' safety.

## **What is FDTL for Cabin Crew?**

**Flight and Duty Time Limitations (FDTL)** refer to the rules governing how long cabin crew members can be on duty or operate flights. These limits prevent fatigue, which could compromise safety. The **DGCA** has established FDTL rules to maintain operational safety, reduce risks, and ensure that crew members get enough rest between flights.

## **Why is DGCA-CAR-7-J-I-FDTL Important for Cabin Crew?**

This regulation ensures that cabin crew in India work within legally set hours. Overworking can lead to fatigue, which affects decision-making and alertness—both crucial for handling emergencies and providing excellent service onboard. The FDTL also helps in managing schedules efficiently and avoiding excessive working hours.

## **Key Points of DGCA-CAR-7-J-I-FDTL (2018)**

Here's a breakdown of the important elements from this regulation that all cabin crew should know:

*   #### **Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP):**
    
    The total time a cabin crew is on duty, from reporting for duty until the aircraft is parked after the last flight. Depending on factors like time of day and number of sectors, FDP can range between 10 to 14 hours.

*   #### **Rest Periods:**
    
    After completing a flight, cabin crew must get adequate rest before starting another duty. The minimum rest period is typically equal to the duration of the preceding duty but not less than 12 hours.

#### **Minimum Rest Period (Before the flight)**

(A)   At least as long as the preceding duty period,

**OR**

(B)   (i)  12 Hours

(ii)  14 hours on crossing 3 time zones

(iii) 36 hours on crossing 7 time zones or

Whichever is greater.

The minimum rest, which must be provided before undertaking a flight duty period, shall be:

**Condition**

**Required Rest**

Preceding duty period:

Remains within 3 time zones

12:00

or

Length of preceding duty period,

whichever is greater

Preceding duty period:

crosses 3 time zones

14:00

or

Length of preceding duty period,

whichever is greater

Preceding duty period:

crosses 7 time zones

36:00

or

Length of preceding duty period,

whichever is greater

*   #### **Consecutive Days of Duty:**
    
    Cabin crew cannot work for more than **7 consecutive days** without a **weekly rest period** of at least 36 hours.

*   #### **Night Duty:**
    
    Working late hours increases fatigue, so night duties have stricter rules. FDP is reduced if duties extend into **night hours (between 2 AM and 5 AM)**.

*   #### **Standby Duty:**
    
    Even if cabin crew are on standby (ready for a call-out), this period contributes to their overall duty hours.

## **Ensuring Compliance with FDTL Rules**

Airlines in India are responsible for scheduling their cabin crew according to these rules. However, it's equally important for crew members to **track their duty hours**. Many airlines provide tools or apps to help cabin crew monitor their flight and duty time.

Failing to comply with FDTL regulations can lead to penalties for both the crew and the airline, as well as increased risks for everyone onboard.

The maximum flight time and maximum flight duty period are indicated in the following Table.

**Maximum Flight Time**

**Maximum Flight Duty Period**

**No. of Landings**

    6.1.1<= 8:00

12:00

6

6.1.2> 8:00 and <= 11:00

15:00

3

6.1.3> 11:00 and <= 14:00

18:00

1

6.1.4(ULR\*) > 14:00

22:00

1

\* For ULR operations approvals to be sought from DGCA on Case to Case basis for specific city pairs and the departure windows of the flights.

When the FDP starts in the WOCL, the maximum FDP stated in the table shall be reduced by 100% of its encroachment up to a maximum of 2 hours. When the FDP ends in or fully encompasses the WOCL, the maximum FDP stated in the table shall be reduced by 50% of its encroachment.

#### **Maximum Cumulative Flight Time Limitations**

**Calendar Day Span**

**Flight Time Limitation**

7 Consecutive Days

40:00

28 Consecutive Days

115:00

90 Consecutive Days

300:00

365 Consecutive Days

1000:00

#### **Cumulative Duty Time Limits**

No operator shall assign **AND** no cabin crew member shall accept any duty to exceed:

**Time Span**

**Duty Limit**

7 Consecutive Days

65:00

28 Consecutive Days

210:00

## **How FDTL Protects Cabin Crew and Passengers**

The DGCA’s FDTL rules are not just about legal compliance; they prioritize safety, health, and well-being. By preventing overworking, FDTL allows cabin crew to remain alert, refreshed, and capable of performing critical tasks during flights. Passengers, in turn, benefit from enhanced safety and better service.

####   

## **Stay Updated with DGCA Regulations**

As a cabin crew member, it’s essential to stay informed about any updates or changes to DGCA’s rules, including FDTL. Regulations are updated based on new research, safety trends, and global best practices.

## **Conclusion**

#### **Understanding FDTL for a Safer Work Environment**

The **DGCA-CAR-7-J-I-FDTL (Cabin Crew) 2018** rules provide a clear framework to ensure that cabin crew do not experience fatigue from overwork. Following these guidelines protects both the crew and passengers and ensures smooth operations. Always monitor your duty hours and rest periods to comply with the regulations and maintain the high standards of safety in aviation.
