In the realm of civil aviation, safety and meticulous oversight are of paramount importance. Ensuring the fitness of pilots and crew members is a critical aspect of aviation safety. This responsibility falls on the shoulders of medical examiners, who play a pivotal role in certifying the physical well-being of aviation personnel. The aspirant medical examiner registration process through the e-Governance of Civil Aviation (eGCA) has streamlined and digitized the procedure, making it easier for medical professionals to participate in this essential function.

## Understanding Aspirant Medical Examiner Registration

The aspirant medical examiner registration process serves as a gateway for medical professionals who aspire to become authorized medical examiners for civil aviation. This process facilitates the registration of an applicant's details with the eGCA, enabling them to undertake the crucial task of assessing the medical fitness of aviation personnel.

## The Importance of Registration

Registration with the eGCA is pivotal for aspiring medical examiners due to several reasons:

2.  **Medical Council Registration:** Aspiring medical examiners must possess either a valid Medical Council of India (MCI) Registration Number or a State Medical Council Registration Number. This requirement ensures that applicants are qualified medical professionals with the necessary credentials.
