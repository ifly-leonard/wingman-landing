# Why Pilots Hate Logbooks (And Why It's Time to Go Digital)

---

Let’s be honest: **pilots hate paperwork**.

I don’t care if you’re flying an Airbus A380 or a Cessna 152 — the moment you land and someone reminds you, "Don't forget to update your logbook," a tiny part of your soul sighs in defeat.

And it's not just a feeling. It's a fact, backed by pilot forums, surveys, and decades of collective moaning in every flight club, airline crew room, and aviation WhatsApp group. **Maintaining a paper logbook is the single most tedious, error-prone, soul-sucking task in aviation** after watching 6-hour recurrent CRM training videos.


### The Pain is Real (And Global)

Around the world, pilots have confessed:
- **"I hate keeping two different sets of documents (written and electronic) in sync."** (Reddit, r/flying)
- **"After manually entering 1,700 hours into a digital log, I wanted to rip my fingernails off."** (AOPA Pilot Magazine)
- **"My paper logbook was a mess. I realized I'd forgotten 20 hours."** (Reddit)

Even on the legendary PPRuNe forums, airline pilots casually admit that **math errors, missing endorsements, and lost flight records** are almost a rite of passage for paper-loggers. One first officer described maintaining a paper log alongside company systems as "too much," which is airline-speak for "this is hell."

**Why does this happen?** Because human beings are terrible at manually totaling hundreds of flights, ferry sectors, day/night splits, and dual/PIC/INSTR/EXAM categories across thousands of hours. One simple mistake and your whole CA39 form is out the window — or worse, your license revalidation is at risk.

And don’t even get me started on losing your paper logbook. One coffee spill, one theft, one "oops forgot it at the FBO," and your entire flying career evaporates like Jet A1 fuel on hot tarmac.


### The World is Moving (Fast)

**50% of pilots globally have already switched to digital logging** (LinkedIn Poll, 2025). Only 25% cling to paper logs — and even they admit it's mostly out of habit, not because they *love* the smell of ink and leather-bound regrets.

Why the shift?
- **Time savings.** Logging a flight takes seconds, not minutes.
- **No math errors.** Totals, currency checks, night time? Auto-calculated.
- **Cloud backup.** Lose your phone? Buy a new one. Your data’s safe.
- **Professional presentation.** Digital logs print cleaner for interviews and audits.
- **Stress-free compliance.** Digital logs can trigger alerts before you violate FTLs.

Even regulators like **FAA** and **EASA** now recognize properly maintained digital logbooks as *official records*. The excuse "but will it be accepted?" is dead. Gone. Buried.


### Private Pilots Are Waking Up Too

General Aviation pilots once held onto paper with the same stubborn pride as tailwheel endorsements. But that's changing. New students today are starting **directly with apps**, bypassing paper altogether. Veteran pilots? They're hedging their bets: dual-logging on both paper and digital until trust kicks in. (Spoiler: it always kicks in.)

The most common realization?
> **"I could be spending my time prepping for flights, not adding up totals with a calculator."

No one flies because they enjoy clerical work.


### The Bottom Line: Pilots Deserve Better

**Pilots are aviators. Not secretaries.**

In 2025, there’s absolutely no reason for pilots to lose sleep over logbooks. None. Not when there are tools built by pilots, for pilots, with one mission:

**Kill the paperwork. Save your flying career.**


### So Here's the Solution

- **Switch to a digital logbook app.**
  - Wingman Logbook

- **Set it up once.**
  - Load your previous hours, sync your roster, set defaults.

- **Back it up.**
  - Use a cloud system. Never lose your flight data again.

- **Print summaries when needed.**
  - For DGCA, FAA, airline interviews, visa applications — print a clean, professional record in minutes.

- **Enjoy more flying, less scribbling.**

**Pilots belong in the sky, not hunched over paper with a calculator.**

Go digital. Save your sanity. Fly more.


(*P.S.: If you still think you "like" paper logs, wait until you have to tally 1,500 hours manually for your ATPL application. You'll download a digital logbook app so fast, your stylus will break.*)
